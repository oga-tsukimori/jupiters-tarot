Also, update the button styles in `styles/commonStyles.ts` to ensure consistency.\n*   **Glass Effect**: Implement the glass effect using `react-native-blur` or similar libraries. Wrap relevant components (like the `SpreadSelector` or card display areas) with a `BlurView` to achieve the desired frosted glass look.\n*   **Custom Chat**: Create a new `ChatScreen.tsx` component. This screen will include:\n    *   A text input field for users to type their questions.\n    *   A display area to show the conversation history.\n    *   Logic to process the user's question and provide a relevant spread-based answer. This could involve using the existing card interpretation logic or generating new interpretations based on the spread.\n    *   Consider using a library like `react-native-gifted-chat` for a pre-built chat UI.\n*   **Integration**: Add a button or navigation item to access the `ChatScreen.tsx` from the main app interface (e.g., in `app/index.tsx` or `ReadingScreen.tsx`).\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-21T16:14:47.473738"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you enhance your tarot reading app with Human Interface Design System elements and add a custom chat feature!
